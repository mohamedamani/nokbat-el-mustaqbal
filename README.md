## 🎓 AI Teaching Methodology

### Educational Philosophy
Our AI doesn't just provide answers—it **teaches like a human teacher would:**

1. **Assess prior knowledge** - Understanding what the student already knows
2. **Break down complex concepts** - Step-by-step explanations
3. **Provide multiple approaches** - Different ways to solve the same problem
4. **Use real-world examples** - Connecting abstract concepts to daily life
5. **Identify misconceptions** - Correcting common mistakes
6. **Reinforce learning** - Practice problems and review sessions
7. **Adapt to learning style** - Visual, auditory, or kinesthetic approaches

### Example: Teaching Quadratic Equations

Instead of just showing the formula, our AI:

1. **Introduces the concept** with a real-world problem (e.g., projectile motion)
2. **Explains the standard form** ax² + bx + c = 0
3. **Demonstrates multiple solution methods:**
   - Factoring (when applicable)
   - Completing the square (showing the derivation)
   - Quadratic formula (with step-by-step substitution)
   - Graphical method (using parabola visualization)
4. **Provides practice problems** with increasing complexity
5. **Shows common mistakes** and how to avoid them
6. **Connects to other topics** (parabolas, optimization, physics applications)
